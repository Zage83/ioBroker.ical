**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

This adapter allows to read .ics files from specific URL and parse it (Google Calendar or iCal). 
Alternatively it is possible to use a local `.ics` file (use absolute path to the file instead of URL)
